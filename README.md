Project Title: "Machine Learning-Enhanced Computational Modeling of Metal-Protein Interactions"

Project Description:  The goal of this project was to enhance the modeling of metal-protein interactions with accuracy and efficiency. Data was generated using the Effective Fragment Potential (EFP) method. Using Python scripts, the data was extracted to be used as input data for the machine learning model. The model chosen was a Deep Neural Network (DNN). The majority of the work of this project consisted of programming the neural network model with a focus on refining the parameters. In the end, the DNN was very successful in predicting the key energies used to model metal-protein interactions.

Software and Data can be found under the "EFP_Data" and "ML_Models" directories.
